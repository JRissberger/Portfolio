                <h4>Featured Project: Astro Outlaw</h4>
                <p>In this bullet hell and exploration hybrid, you play as a pirate on her quest to travel the galaxy and find the ultimate treasure. Gather important resources on the planets 
                you land on, before returning to space to travel to your next destination. But watch out--your rivals will stop at nothing to destroy your ship before you make it 
                to your next destination. You'll have to use all the resources at your disposal to fight your way through space!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This project was created with a team of 5 other students.</li>
                    <li>Developed in Unity, utilizing C#.</li>
                    <li>Primarily developed the player's controls, interactions, and abilities in combat.</li>
                    <li>Additionally developed the game's boss fight, which currently acts as the final challenge of the game.</li>
                    <li>Assisted with conducting and documenting playtests, miscellaneous tasks, and bug fixes as needed.</li>

                <h4>About me</h4>
                <p>I am a 3rd year Game Design and Development major at RIT. While I have done work encompassing both design and development, I particularly enjoy the programming aspect of my major. 
                    My goal with programming is to be able to express my creativity, while still working within the logical constraints of computing. I'm passionate about
                    my work, and I'm always eager to learn more and continue to improve my skills.
